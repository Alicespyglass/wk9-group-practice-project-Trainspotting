# Find My Train ![alt text](https://travis-ci.org/whatsrupp/train-spotter.svg?branch=master 'travis build stamp')
## An app to find out which train you're on

# Overview
It's hard to explain the functionality of the app in words so here's a user experience flowchart of'Find My Train':

Hopefully, that gives you the gist of what we're aiming to do. This app was conceptualised from the following key problem statement:

#### 'I need to tell friends when I'll arrive but I don't have that information to hand'

### Setup
Currently there is no app to look at, it's all one enormous thought baby but we're currently working towards our MVP (minimum viable product).

### Developers
We're a small team of 4 aiming to build this product in a week. Fingers crossed!

### Approach
#### 1) Brainstorm:
To start thing off we outlined our key problem statement and brainstormed some features we would want to include in the app. The useful output from that session is shown below

#### 2) Research:
"I'd say our research was thorough, in-depth and useful" (Absolutely No One On Our Team - 2017 )

Key focuses on:
- Which platform to deploy on?
- Which APIs for messaging, trains and geolocation already exist?

#### 3) User Stories:

```
As a commuter
I want...
```
```
the app to find out the nearest station
the app to tell me what train I'm currently on
to tell the app where I'm going
the ability to send my travel details to my friend
the app to check for delay updates?
```
